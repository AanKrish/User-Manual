## WHAT IS DRIVING DISTRESS IN THE WORKPLACE?
A tsunami of traumatic events devastated our world as we knew it in 2020. Even before 2020, workers were already feeling distressed in the workplace. Distress in the workplace can be caused by a variety of factors. Some common drivers of distress in the workplace include: 
- Workload: Heavy Workloads, unrealistic deadlines, and a lack of support or resources can lead to stress and burnout.
- Work Life Balance: A lack of balance between work and personal life can lead to stress, exhaustion, and a feeling of overwhelmed.
- Poor Management: Poor management practices, lack of communication, and a lack of clear expectations can lead to stress and dissatisfaction among employees.
- Unclear job roles: Unclear job roles and responsibilities can lead to confusion, stress, and conflict among employees.
- Lack of autonomy: A lack of autonomy or control over one’s work led to frustration and stress.
- Discrimination and harassment: Discrimination and harassment can create a toxic work environment, leading to stress and mental health issues for employees.
- Job Insecurity: Fear of job loss, restructuring, or downsizing can lead to stress, anxiety, and burnout.
Let us now take a deeper look at what is driving distress in the workplace in 2021.
#### COVID-19 Pandemic
Lives and businesses were completely disrupted when COVID-19 quickly spread globally from Wuhan, China in late 2019. Governments, businesses, communities, and individuals were not prepared for this historic event and were forced to rapidly adapt. Millions of workers were sent home to work remotely for the first time in their lives. Kids were sent home from school with no immediate plans to resume education, further complicating remote work for many parents.

Traumatic Events Driving Distress in the Workplace:

Essential workers continued to show up to work on the frontlines whether at the hospital or the grocery store. Daily, they feared they might contact the virus or bring it home to their family members. Lockdowns forced everyone to live in isolation, eliminating in-person connection to family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues. Many businesses had to lay off employees creating significant financial stress for individuals as well as business owners. The pandemic also forced scores of women out of the workforce to provide caregiving. There are 1.8 million fewer women in the workforce now than pre-COVID. 

All these major disruptions to our everyday lives had a tremendous impact on our mental health. Fast forward a year and a half later, and we are still struggling.

For a large part of the country, mask policies have been relaxed. While this is great news to many, others are still worried about the spread of the virus. A large part of the population is now vaccinated. 

Many employers have already pushed back their return to the workplace. The pandemic has been a great disrupter in our lives. It’s hard to predict how long the pandemic will last and the damaging effects. 
#### Burnout
Burnout is a state of emotional, mental, and physical exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress. It can happen to anyone – managers and employees alike. With the shift to remote work, studies have shown that productivity has increased. This can largely be attributed to fewer distractions and a more flexible work schedule. However, rates of burnout have increased significantly since the shift to remote work. 
- 89% of respondents said their work life was getting worse.
- 85% said their well-being had declined.
- 56% said their job demands had increased.
- 62% of the people who were struggling to manage their workloads had experienced burnout “often.”
- 57% of employees felt that the pandemic had a large effect on their work.

As employers continue to be challenged with employees changing careers, leaving their jobs and a workforce shortage, more is being expected of employees to fill the gaps. These added responsibilities bring more pressure to an already overworked workforce, causing higher levels of stress and burnout.
#### Uncertainty Around the Return to the Workplace
For those whose jobs transitioned to remote work during the pandemic, employers are now inviting – and in some cases demanding – them back into the workplace. While there are individuals who are more than ready to return to the office, many are not ready to return due to concerns about personal health and safety, while others do not wish to return because they enjoy working remotely. Returning to the workplace with no end to the pandemic in sight is causing prominent levels of anxiety and stress. According to a study conducted by McKinsey, 49 percent of employees surveyed expect that the return to the office will have a negative impact on their mental health. Of those who have returned to the workplace, 36 percent reported negative mental health effects from working on-site.
#### Alcohol and Substance Use is Exploding
Recent data from the CDC reports that there was a 29.4 percent increase in drug overdose deaths between December 2019 and December 2020.11 Substance use is exploding and is going to continue to climb even as we get on the other side of the pandemic. People have increased their alcohol intake as a mechanism to cope with anxiety, depression, and loneliness. As employees return to the workplace, substance abuse issues will show up too.
#### Individuals with No History of Counseling or Coaching are Seeking Help
The demand for mental health support is skyrocketing. There has been increase in the number of individuals who have no history of receiving counseling services for mental health concerns. This can be attributed to the events of the last year and a half. But this is also a sign that the stigma around mental health is improving. While it is comforting to see more people asking for help, the increased demand is putting more strain on a mental health system that is already difficult to access. The limited availability of providers is creating longer wait times for those who need timely access to services. At a time when individuals must get help, the slightest roadblock can prevent them from getting the support they need.
#### Grief and Loss
Grief and loss have been major themes throughout the pandemic. At the beginning of the pandemic, it was extremely difficult to appropriately mourn loved ones. Virtual funerals have been the toughest and most heartbreaking to attend and closure has been challenging to attain. The pandemic has also caused grief for many through the loss of life experiences. Weddings, birthdays, graduations, anniversaries, vacations, and countless other events have been impacted. Uncertainty about the future is also causing anticipatory grief, leaving people constantly worried about what is going to happen next.
#### Impact on Physical Health
The pandemic has not only put an enormous strain on our mental health, but it has also had a profound impact on physical health. Throughout 2020, many people skipped regular health examinations, whether it was out of fear of getting infected by COVID-19, or healthcare systems not having enough capacity. The added anxiety and stress from the pandemic itself, as well as the other traumatic events also have an impact on physical health. Lack of sleep, eating disorders, weight gain or loss are all effects of prolonged stress and anxiety. The ongoing psychological effects of the pandemic will continue to have an impact on physical health throughout the COVID Era.
