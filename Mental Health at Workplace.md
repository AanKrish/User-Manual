## WHAT IS DRIVING DISTRESS IN THE WORKPLACE?
A tsunami of traumatic events devastated our world as we knew it in 2020. Even before 2020, workers were already feeling distressed in the workplace. Distress in the workplace can be caused by a variety of factors. Some common drivers of distress in the workplace include: 
- Workload: Heavy Workloads, unrealistic deadlines, and a lack of support or resources can lead to stress and burnout.
- Work Life Balance: A lack of balance between work and personal life can lead to stress, exhaustion, and a feeling of overwhelmed.
- Poor Management: Poor management practices, lack of communication, and a lack of clear expectations can lead to stress and dissatisfaction among employees.
- Unclear job roles: Unclear job roles and responsibilities can lead to confusion, stress, and conflict among employees.
- Lack of autonomy: A lack of autonomy or control over one’s work led to frustration and stress.
- Discrimination and harassment: Discrimination and harassment can create a toxic work environment, leading to stress and mental health issues for employees.
- Job Insecurity: Fear of job loss, restructuring, or downsizing can lead to stress, anxiety, and burnout.
Let us now take a deeper look at what is driving distress in the workplace in 2021.
#### COVID-19 Pandemic
Lives and businesses were completely disrupted when COVID-19 quickly spread globally from Wuhan, China in late 2019. Governments, businesses, communities, and individuals were not prepared for this historic event and were forced to rapidly adapt. Millions of workers were sent home to work remotely for the first time in their lives. Kids were sent home from school with no immediate plans to resume education, further complicating remote work for many parents.

Essential workers continued to show up to work on the frontlines whether at the hospital or the grocery store. Daily, they feared they might contact the virus or bring it home to their family members. Lockdowns forced everyone to live in isolation, eliminating in-person connection to family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues. Many businesses had to lay off employees creating significant financial stress for individuals as well as business owners. The pandemic also forced scores of women out of the workforce to provide caregiving. There are 1.8 million fewer women in the workforce now than pre-COVID. 

All these major disruptions to our everyday lives had a tremendous impact on our mental health. Fast forward a year and a half later, and we are still struggling.

For a large part of the country, mask policies have been relaxed. While this is great news to many, others are still worried about the spread of the virus. A large part of the population is now vaccinated. 

Many employers have already pushed back their return to the workplace. The pandemic has been a great disrupter in our lives. It’s hard to predict how long the pandemic will last and the damaging effects.
