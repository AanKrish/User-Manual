## WHAT IS DRIVING DISTRESS IN THE WORKPLACE?

A tsunami of traumatic events devastated our world as we knew it in 2020. Even before 2020, workers were already feeling distressed in the workplace. Distress in the workplace can be caused by a variety of factors. Some common drivers of distress in the workplace include: 
- Workload: Heavy Workloads, unrealistic deadlines, and a lack of support or resources can lead to stress and burnout.
- Work Life Balance: A lack of balance between work and personal life can lead to stress, exhaustion, and a feeling of overwhelmed.
- Poor Management: Poor management practices, lack of communication, and a lack of clear expectations can lead to stress and dissatisfaction among employees.
- Unclear job roles: Unclear job roles and responsibilities can lead to confusion, stress, and conflict among employees.
- Lack of autonomy: A lack of autonomy or control over one’s work led to frustration and stress.
- Discrimination and harassment: Discrimination and harassment can create a toxic work environment, leading to stress and mental health issues for employees.
- Job Insecurity: Fear of job loss, restructuring, or downsizing can lead to stress, anxiety, and burnout.

Let us now take a deeper look at what is driving distress in the workplace in 2021.

#### COVID-19 Pandemic

Lives and businesses were completely disrupted when COVID-19 quickly spread globally from Wuhan, China in late 2019. Governments, businesses, communities, and individuals were not prepared for this historic event and were forced to rapidly adapt. Millions of workers were sent home to work remotely for the first time in their lives. Kids were sent home from school with no immediate plans to resume education, further complicating remote work for many parents.

Traumatic Events Driving Distress in the Workplace:

Essential workers continued to show up to work on the frontlines whether at the hospital or the grocery store. Daily, they feared they might contact the virus or bring it home to their family members. Lockdowns forced everyone to live in isolation, eliminating in-person connection to family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues. Many businesses had to lay off employees creating significant financial stress for individuals as well as business owners. The pandemic also forced scores of women out of the workforce to provide caregiving. There are 1.8 million fewer women in the workforce now than pre-COVID. 

All these major disruptions to our everyday lives had a tremendous impact on our mental health. Fast forward a year and a half later, and we are still struggling.

For a large part of the country, mask policies have been relaxed. While this is great news to many, others are still worried about the spread of the virus. A large part of the population is now vaccinated. 

Many employers have already pushed back their return to the workplace. The pandemic has been a great disrupter in our lives. It’s hard to predict how long the pandemic will last and the damaging effects. 

#### Burnout

Burnout is a state of emotional, mental, and physical exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress. It can happen to anyone – managers and employees alike. With the shift to remote work, studies have shown that productivity has increased. This can largely be attributed to fewer distractions and a more flexible work schedule. However, rates of burnout have increased significantly since the shift to remote work. 
- 89% of respondents said their work life was getting worse.
- 85% said their well-being had declined.
- 56% said their job demands had increased.
- 62% of the people who were struggling to manage their workloads had experienced burnout “often.”
- 57% of employees felt that the pandemic had a large effect on their work.

As employers continue to be challenged with employees changing careers, leaving their jobs and a workforce shortage, more is being expected of employees to fill the gaps. These added responsibilities bring more 
pressure to an already overworked workforce, causing higher levels of stress and burnout.

#### Uncertainty Around the Return to the Workplace

For those whose jobs transitioned to remote work during the pandemic, employers are now inviting – and in some cases demanding – them back into the workplace. While there are individuals who are more than ready to return to the office, many are not ready to return due to concerns about personal health and safety, while others do not wish to return because they enjoy working remotely. Returning to the workplace with no end to the pandemic in sight is causing prominent levels of anxiety and stress. According to a study conducted by McKinsey, 49 percent of employees surveyed expect that the return to the office will have a negative impact on their mental health. Of those who have returned to the workplace, 36 percent reported negative mental health effects from working on-site.

#### Alcohol and Substance Use is Exploding

Recent data from the CDC reports that there was a 29.4 percent increase in drug overdose deaths between December 2019 and December 2020.11 Substance use is exploding and is going to continue to climb even as we get on the other side of the pandemic. People have increased their alcohol intake as a mechanism to cope with anxiety, depression, and loneliness. As employees return to the workplace, substance abuse issues will show up too.

#### Individuals with No History of Counseling or Coaching are Seeking Help

The demand for mental health support is skyrocketing. There has been increase in the number of individuals who have no history of receiving counseling services for mental health concerns. This can be attributed to the events of the last year and a half. But this is also a sign that the stigma around mental health is improving. While it is comforting to see more people asking for help, the increased demand is putting more strain on a mental health system that is already difficult to access. The limited availability of providers is creating longer wait times for those who need timely access to services. At a time when individuals must get help, the slightest roadblock can prevent them from getting the support they need.

#### Grief and Loss

Grief and loss have been major themes throughout the pandemic. At the beginning of the pandemic, it was extremely difficult to appropriately mourn loved ones. Virtual funerals have been the toughest and most heartbreaking to attend and closure has been challenging to attain. The pandemic has also caused grief for many through the loss of life experiences. Weddings, birthdays, graduations, anniversaries, vacations, and countless other events have been impacted. Uncertainty about the future is also causing anticipatory grief, leaving people constantly worried about what is going to happen next.

#### Impact on Physical Health

The pandemic has not only put an enormous strain on our mental health, but it has also had a profound impact on physical health. Throughout 2020, many people skipped regular health examinations, whether it was out of fear of getting infected by COVID-19, or healthcare systems not having enough capacity. The added anxiety and stress from the pandemic itself, as well as the other traumatic events also have an impact on physical health. Lack of sleep, eating disorders, weight gain or loss are all effects of prolonged stress and anxiety. The ongoing psychological effects of the pandemic will continue to have an impact on physical health throughout the COVID Era.

## IMPACT ON THE WORKPLACE

It is documented that unresolved mental health issues can decrease work performance and company morale and increase absenteeism, turnover, safety incidents, and claims costs.

In the first half of 2021, BHS has seen the following year-over-year workplace management referrals trends:

#### Absenteeism and Presenteeism

It is well noted that mental health is a major cause of employee absenteeism and presenteeism. The above trends often lead to unplanned, prolonged absences from work. They also prevent employees from being fully present during work hours. These unplanned absences and distractions can be very costly to organizations. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, productivity losses linked to absenteeism are roughly $1,685 per employee. The cost presenteeism is nearly 10x greater than absenteeism, with the average number of days lost at 57.5.

#### Recruitment and Retention

According to a survey conducted by Eagle Hill Consulting at the beginning of 2021, a quarter of employees indicated that they were planning to quit their jobs post-COVID. While career mobility, new challenges and better pay are contributing factors for people leaving their jobs. As per the Survey burnout is the major cause for wanting to quit a job. The pandemic gave individuals time to reflect on what is important to them, including prioritizing mental health. The average cost of replacing an employee is six to nine months of the employee’s salary. That means for an employee making $50,000 per year, recruiting and training costs are $25,000- $37,500. In professional services professions such as legal and healthcare, the impact is much greater. Replacing employees can cost hundreds of thousands and even into the millions of dollars.

#### Lower Employee Engagement

Before the pandemic, employers have struggled with employee engagement. A Gallup poll in 2018 revealed that more than half of workers (53 percent) are not engaged. When this happens, workers show up and do the bare minimum required, and are more likely to leave their organization for a slightly better offer. A Gallup employee engagement poll for the first half of 2021 reports that only 36 percent of U.S. employees are engaged in their work and workplace. In addition to reduced employee loyalty, employees who are not engaged can impact the morale of their teams, especially when they must constantly pick up the slack of employees who are not fully productive.

#### Distractions and Safety Concerns

Employee safety becomes a major risk when workers are not fully present on the job. Distracted workers are more likely to be involved in a workplace accident. An Australian study on the association between psy
chological distress and workplace accidents found that the odds ratio of an accident increased to 1.4 for employees in moderate and high psychological distress. With increased risk comes increased liability for organizations. Workplace accidents can lead to increased workers’ compensation claims, lawsuits and legal expenses, lost customers, and employee turnover.

## IMPACT BY INDUSTRY

Industries have all been impacted greatly by the pandemic and the events of the last year and a half, but the specific nature of certain professions brought unique challenges. Let’s look at how mental health issues are impacting healthcare, first responders, professional services, and education.

#### Healthcare

The impact of the pandemic on the mental well-being of healthcare workers has been devastating. Healthcare workers are beyond burnout. They have not had a break since the start of the pandemic. When the number of COVID-19 cases started declining in 2021, individuals started flooding hospitals and for treatment and procedures they had put off during the pandemic. More than half (56 percent) say that worry or stress related to COVID-19 has caused them to experience trouble with sleeping or sleeping too much (47 percent), frequent headaches or stomachaches (31 percent), or increased alcohol or drug use (16 percent). 

#### First Responders

Like healthcare workers, first responders have been greatly impacted by the pandemic. According to data compiled by the Officer Down Memorial Page and the National Police Foundation, more law enforcement officers died from COVID than from gun violence, car accidents and all other causes combined.25 As public-facing figures, social distancing is not possible, putting many first responders at greater risk of infection. Police officers are also drained and do not feel that they are getting the support they need. More officers are leaving the police force as a result. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel have also experienced worsening mental health since the beginning of the pandemic. Like police officers, many EMS providers are considering a career change. The survey revealed that 33 percent of respondents were thinking about changing careers due to the pandemic.

#### Professional and Business Services

Burnout is the most common mental health challenge within the professional and business services sector. As mentioned earlier, many professional services workers transitioned to working remotely for the first time at the beginning of the pandemic. During the first months of the pandemic when most of the country was in lockdown and isolation, working irregular and longer hours became the norm for many. A year later, employees are feeling more burned out than the year prior. In the legal profession, 50 percent of employees reported experiencing burnout during the first quarter of 2021 according to a Bloomberg Law survey. A previous survey during the same quarter in 2020 reported 40 percent of employees were experiencing burnout. Additionally, 41 percent of senior associates and two-thirds of junior- and mid-level associates reported a decline in their well-being.

#### Education    

The toll of the pandemic on education has been detrimental for educators and students alike. Teachers are exhausted, stressed and burned out. Since the start of the pandemic, teachers (and students) have been asked to adjust to remote, hybrid and in-person teaching. Teachers in a hybrid or in-person environment also have the same fears as healthcare workers about transmitting COVID-19 to family members. Like many other industries, teachers are also leaving or are considering leaving the profession. Like many other industries, teachers are also leaving or are considering leaving the profession. Students are also struggling through the pandemic. A study on the Effects of COVID-19 on College Students’ Mental Health in the United States revealed that 71 percent of students felt an increase in stress and anxiety. Other negative effects included fear and worry about their health, difficulty concentrating, poor sleeping patterns and decreased social interaction.

## STRATEGIES FOR ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH IN THE “COVID ERA”

As some organizations prepare to invite individuals back to the workplace, they must have a clear strategy for addressing mental health and wellbeing. 


Here are several strategies to address mental health in the new workplace :

#### Invest in Empathetic Leadership

Empathy is a trait that we all have, and it is strengthened the more we believe it. Now is the perfect time for leaders and managers to start practicing empathy. Continually investing in empathetic leadership will be a growing part of every leader’s role. Empathy in leaders is directly correlated with decreasing an individual’s chance of burnout and increasing their sense of belonging. This can contribute to overall loyalty and commitment to the organization. As organizations create their return-to-office plans and visualize managing a hybrid workforce, they will need to rely on their leaders to manage in a flexible and empathetic manner.

#### Provide Mental Health Training for Leadership and Managers

For Leadership and Managers In this period of change and constant adjustments, we must look out for one another. Frontline managers play a critical role in supporting the well-being of their employees. They are going to be called on to lead the charge back into the workplace. Leaders and managers must respond appropriately when an employee is in distress or needs help. This does not mean that it is the job of a manager to be a therapist. But managers need to be able to recognize when there is an issue, be comfortable addressing it and know the well-being resources available that can help. Organizations must ensure that management-level employees are thoroughly trained to have critical conversations around mental health in the workplace. Training should be part of a long-term strategy and scheduled at regular intervals to keep ensuring progress is being made in transforming organizational culture.

#### Carefully Consider Return to the Workplace Plans

While many workers never left the workplace during the pandemic, others have adjusted to working remotely for well over a year. Employers who are inviting their people back to work will have many challenges to overcome. Communicate the plan clearly for returning to the office, whether you expect employees to work a hybrid schedule or return full-time. The communication should detail when employees are expected to return, any new policies and safety protocols, changes to the office layout, and most importantly, the “why” behind the return to the workplace. Be very clear about the benefits of returning to the workplace, including building a connection with co-workers, better innovation, and increased communication

#### Understand and Prevent Burnout

Effectively managing and preventing burnout requires strategies that impact individuals, teams, and organizations overall. At their core, these strategies may represent a cultural change within the management of a company to set different expectations around setting a healthier work-life balance. These strategies can be implemented at micro, mezzo, and macro levels.
- Micro interventions include encouraging employees to take regular short breaks throughout their day.
- Mezzo interventions can consist of encouraging employees to take non-working lunch breaks.
- Macro interventions such as taking a vacation and not working (this is challenging for many workers) is a great way to recharge your batteries.

These small steps can go a long way in mitigating the risk for burnout and towards creating a workplace culture that cultivates positive morale, employee engagement, and retention.

#### Invest in Mental Health Benefits

s organizations continue to navigate the pandemic era landscape, it will be important to offer well-being benefits that engage employees. Now is a great time to evaluate or optimize mental well-being resources. If your organization offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP), that may be a good start, but consider performing some due diligence to determine if your program is truly capable of meeting the moment, we are in. As more individuals prioritize their mental health, now is the time for organizations to invest in developing a sustainable mental health strategy and high-quality resources.

## Conclusion

COVID-19 affected everyone at global level. Previously 100 years ago this lockdown was implemented to fight with Spanish Flu. Now in this COVID-19 people are also feeling tired and anxiety due to lockdown. These all things lead to cause disturbance in their mental state. The conclusion of the study is that employees are having the stress level at severe level and by the increasing days stress level is also increasing. Many employees are also using the coping strategies like yoga, exercise, diversion therapy such as spending time with family and watching television. The depression level of the employees working only from home is higher than other employees. Moreover, the depression level of women, young employees, and those whose life quality was adversely affected by the coronavirus is higher than the rest. In prioritizing employees’ mental health as part of return planning, employers can reduce stress and anxiety for their workers. In doing so, employers can contribute to improved mental health in the workforce. Understanding, prioritizing, and planning for employees’ post-pandemic mental health is an important part of an organization’s return-to-work strategy.
